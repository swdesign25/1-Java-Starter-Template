# Java Starter project task

There are two directories:
* t0-example
* t1-java-oop

In the t0-example-directory of the starter project you find an example Java Maven project. Your task is to create a similar project to the t1-java-oop -folder with slightly larger functionality. The solution project should contain

* interface
* abstract class
* class that implements the interface
* a class that extends the abstract class
